        <h1>The Story of Frozen</h1>

        <div class="kotak">Fearless optimist Anna teams up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven and sets off on an epic journey to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret: she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a <span class="visibility1">beautiful ability</span>, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.</div>
        <div class="kotak">In the Kingdom of Arendelle, <span class="visibility2">Princess Elsa</span> has the power to create and freeze ice and snow, and her younger sister Anna loves to play with her. When Elsa accidentally hits Anna on the head with her powers and almost kills her, their parents take them to trolls that save Anna's life and make her forget her sister's ability. Elsa returns to the castle and stays reclusively in her room with fear of hurting Anna with her increasing power. Their <span>parents</span> die when their ship sinks into the ocean, and three years later Elsa's coronation forces her to open her castle gates to celebrate with the people. Anna meets <span>Prince Hans</span> at the party and immediately falls in love and decides to marry him. But Elsa doesn't approve, loses control of her powers, and freezes Arendelle. Elsa flees to the mountain and Anna teams up with the peasant Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and the snowman Olaf to seek out Elsa. They find her in her icy castle and she accidentally hits Anna in the heart; now only true love can save her sister from death.</div>
